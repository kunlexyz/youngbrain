<div class="pa paj">
Living things transport materials within them in orderr to utilize water and food substances, actualize the process of excretion and respiration; circulate hormones in higher organisms etc. Method or mechanism of transport in an organisms will depend on the size of the organism, surface area to volume ratio which in turn depends on the size of the organism. Simple unicellular, Organism like amoeba for instance, make do with simple diffusion process for material transport while higher organisms require a more specialized mechanism for transport.
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
<h4>
Transport in Animals
</h4>
Animals are higher organisms. Their low surface area to volume ratio as a result of their sizes cannot allow simple diffusion which occurs in much more smaller organisms like amoeba to be their means of transport. Special structures and mechanisms are developed for such purpose. These structures include: <strong>Gills, lungs,.</strong> <b class="u">heart</b> etc Besides this, animals have a transport system where a uid carries materials through  out the body <strong>(mass ow system)</strong>
</div>
<ol type="i">
Features of a transport system
<li>A circulating uid (usually blood in most cases)
</li><li>A pumping device (the heart) Which drives the        uid through its pumping action
</li><li>Connecting vessels or system of branched         tubes within which the uid circulate.
</li></ol>
<div class="pa paj">
In a given animal, Transport system which is also referred to as the circulatory system can be open circulation (in which the heart pumps blood into blood vessels which opens into spaces in the body cavity) or a closed circulation (where blood does not have a direct contact with the body cavity but ows through blood vessels)
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
Open circulation is found among insects, muluscs etc while closed circulation is found among all vertebrates.
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
<h4 class="ce">Circulatory system in vertebrates</h4>
Circulatory system in Vertebrates is by closed circulation. It has the following features:
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
<ol type="i">
<li>A distinct Muscular heart which is ventrally         positioned </li><li>Arteries which carry blood away from the heart </li><li>Veins which carry blood back to the heart(iv) Blood capillaries between the veins and the Arteries</li></ol>
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
The circulatory system in vertebrates is further divided into two categories:
</div>
<ul type="square">
<li><b>Single circulation</b> in which blood passes     once through the heart and goes into      general body circulation and</li>
<li>
<b>Double circulation</b> in which blood passes through the heart twice before going into general body circulation. The rst is called <b>Pulmonary circulation</b> (blood circulation from the heart to the lungs and back to the heart).The second is <b>systemic circulation</b>(circulation from the heart to all other parts of the body and back to the heart). Among vertebrates A sh has single circulation while all mammals has double circulation</li>
</ul>

<div class="pa paj">
<h4>Circulatory System in Mammals</h4>
The circulatory system in mammals is double circulation. It consist of
</div>

<strong>
<ol type="i">
<li>The transporting media and material       which are the blood, lymph and intercellular uid</li>
<li>The muscular four chambered heart and</li>
<li>The blood vessels</li>
</ol>
</strong>

<div class="pa paj">
<h4>The blood</h4> 
<i><strong>The blood is a tissue, which consists of the liquid part, called blood plasma,</strong> and the solid part made up of <strong>blood cells, or corpuscles and platelet.</strong></i>

Lymph and Intercellular Fluid
</h4><b>
Intercellular Fluid (Tissue Fluid):</b> This is the uid found in the immediate surrounding of the cell. The intercellular uid is the plasma that lters out through the capillary walls and occupies the cells surrounding. The Lymph: The lymph is the uid in the lymphatic vessel

<h4 class="ce">The Heart</h4>
<b>Location:</b>At the chest region in between the two lungs and embedded within the pericardium membrane.
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
<b>Shape and form:</b> Conical in shape but hollow and muscular in form.
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
<b>Functional features and structure:</b> The heart is made up of special muscles called cardiac muscles (an involuntary muscle), which sustain contraction and relaxation of the heart twenty-four hours each day, and for life. The non stop operation of the heart also requires a good supply of blood to provide oxygen and food. This function is performed by the coronary arteries and veins. The heart of mammals is made up of four chambers. The left atrium (left auricle), right atrium (right auricle), left ventricle and right ventricle.

<h4 class="u">Transport in plants</h4>
The main transport media in plants are <b>cytoplasm</b> in simple plants like algae, <b>plant sap</b> and cell sap, which are contained in vascular bundle, and <b>latex tubes</b> for higher plants (vascular plants).The sap in vascular tissues consists of water up to 98% and a mixture of organic and inorganic solutes dissolved in it.
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
The major materials being transported in plants are <b>carbon dioxide, water vapour, oxygen, water, mineral salts, manufactured food, hormones and pigments</b>
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
anufactured food, hormones and pigmentsGases are transported in and out. Water vapour diffuses out through stomata at the leaves. Carbon dioxide and oxygen diffuses both in and out of the plant through the stomata in the leaves and lenticels on stems and roots.
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
Water and mineral salts are absorbed by the root hairs of plants. Absorption of water by root hairs takes place by diffusion while the absorption and uptake of mineral salts involves active transport. Water and mineral salts being absorbed by the roots eventually gets to the zylem. Water can also get through to the zylem vessel through the cell wall and cytoplasm by diffusion and capillary action.
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
<h4 class="ce h_bio">TRANSPORT OFWATER BYTHE ZYLEM TISSUE</h4>
<ol type="i">
<li>(i)Root pressure and capillary action: This causes water to move up to a particular height but not up to the leaves.
</li><li>Transpiration pull: This is a pull that continuously draws water in columns from the zylem vessel to the leaves. This gives rise to transport stream
