Background Information
</h4>
<strong>The law of Segregation of genes and (ii) The law of independent assortment of genes</strong> (Mendel did not use the word genes rather he used the wordfactors).
</div>

<div class="pa paj">
Law of Segregation of genes: The law can be summarized below
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
*Heritable characters of an organism are determined by factors (genes) which are discrete (No mixing or blending) unit of inheritance .
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
*Agene for a character may have alternative formscalledalleleswhichshowsthecharacter in different ways.
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
*In an organism with diploid number of chromosomes, each character is controlled by two copies of each gene. This may be identical alleles <strong>(homozygous)</strong> or different alleles <strong>(heterozygous).</strong>
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
Also if a diploid organism has two different alleles (heterozygous) for a character, one allelecanbedominant,dictatingtheexpression of the character while the other (the recessive allele) has itâ€™s character not in appearance.
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
*In a diploid organism that is heterozygous, the two alleles during meiosis separate (segregate) from each other going randomly to a different gamete.
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
<h4 class="h_bio">Law of independent  Assortment</h4>
The first law was as a result of monohybrid crossing (crossing involving only one pair of alleles)mendels law of independent assortment <strong>which states that: the inheritance of alleles for one characteristic does not affect the inheritance for alleles for other characteristic.</strong> This means that, whether a plant is short or tall, for instance , has no effect on whether its seed are smooth or wrinkled, but all the characters separate independently.
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
<h4 class="h_bio">
Cellular Basis for Heredity</h4>One major reason why mendel was neglected for so long was because scientists at that time, had no understanding of cellular basis for heredity. For now the study of the cellular process in sexual reproduction has linked mendels conclusion to the structure of the cell.
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
The cell structure has nucleus which contains chromosomes. It is also common scientific knowledge of the present day that there ia a <strong>body cell</strong> and there is a <strong>sex cell.</strong> Abody cell (somatic cell) has a diploid number of chromosomes 2n. In humans it is 46. Asex cell (gamete) has a haploid number of chromosomes n.In humans it is 23 in number. The matching pairs of chromosomes in a diploid cell are said to be <b>homologous.</b>
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
The chromosome theory tells us that different genes lay on different chromosomes. It is this chromosome theory that gives cellular basis for heredity (and even mendels laws). According to the chromosome theory, chromosomes contain genes which occur in pairs. Only characters controlled by genes can be transmitted. The sum of the genes an offspring inherits from parents is known as its <strong>genotype or genetic make up.</strong> This determines or constitutes the inherited character of an individual, The actual physical expression of the characters is the organisms <strong>phenotype.</strong>
</div>

<h4 class="ce h_bio">
TRANSMISSION AND EXPRESSION OF CHARACTER FROM PARENTS TO OFFSPRING
</h4>

<div class="pa paj">
Agene for a particular character (for instance colour) may have alternative form that will express the character in different ways (say red and white) each alternative form of a gene (red or white for example) is called<strong> allele.</strong>  Such pair of genes is called alleles or an allelic pair. During sexual reproduction, thousands of genes are passed by parents to their offsprings. Though one cannot easilly observe how several thousands of characters are transmitted from generation to generation one can easily monitor the inheritance pattern of a single pair of genes. This is called <strong>single factor inheritance.</strong> Singlefactorinheritance can be studied by a plant that breads true in two contrasting characters e.g Red and white flowered pea plants. The ones that give rise to red flowered pea plants consistently by crossing them among themselves has two genes for red <b>RR</b> which are homozygous. The same thing is application to the white flowered pea plant, on true breed. They give rise to rr for that character. This can be explained by the fact that all the gametes that are a product of the true breed were homozygous for their different flower colours.<strong> An individual is said to be homozygous for a character that has more than one form, if the two copies of the gene controlling that character are identical.</strong> If a monohycrid cross (cross between alleles of one specific character. Flower colour in this case) is carried out by crossing a pure stock of white flowered pea plant. This offspring gives all red flowered pea plant. This offspring gives all red flowered pea plants in the first filial generation.
</div>
<img src="images/fig8.1.jpg" class="imn" />
<div class="pa paj">
Seeing only red flower colour in the F<sub>1</sub>  generation we can conclude that red flower form of flower colour character is dominant white colour characted is <b>recessive.</b>
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
Two copies of alleles now appear RR which is homozygous and Rr which is heterozygous. Crossing F<sub>1</sub> individuals by self pollination to give rise to F<sub>2</sub> generation gives a mixture with roughly Â¾ bearing red flower forms and Â¼ white flowers.
</div>
<img src="images/fig8.2.jpg" class="imn" />
<img src="images/fig8.3.jpg" class="imn" />
<div class="pa paj">
<h4>Ammendments to mendelian genetics</h4>
Although mendels experiments and works form the basis of understanding inheritance, there are however certain findings that do not agree with his inheritance pattern such findings include:

<ul type="square">
<li>Incomplete dominance</li>
<li>Co-dominance</li>
<li>Linkage</li>
<li>Sex determination</li>
<li>Sex linked characters</li>
<li>Multiple Alleles</li>
<li>Polygenic inheritance and</li>
<li>Mutations.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
<h4>Incomplete dominance:</h4> This is a situation whereby two alleles produce a heterozygous phenotype that is different from the two homozygous phenotypes. Example of this crossing of a pure stock red-flowered four 0'cock plant (RR) with a pure stock of white flowered (rr) ones to give rise to pink-flowered (Rr) which is a blending of colour character.
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
<h4>Co-dominance:</h4> In this case, there is a full expression of the character of each allele in the heterozygous individual which result to three distinct phenotypes. This is different from incomplete doominance in that the effect of each allele is not modified by the presence of the other. An example is the inheritance of human <b>ABO</b> blood groups in which two alleles 1^,1<sup>B</sup> in a heterozgous individual gives rise AB blood group. 
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
<h4>Linkage:</h4> A situation whereby genes for characters located on the same chromosomes segregate together in a genetic cross e.g. Body colour and wing shape. In humans, there are 23 linkage groups while <strong>drosophila</strong> there are four linkage groups.
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
Sex determination: In sex determination, the female have two copies of X chromosomes while males have one X and one Y. Female eggs has only X chromosomes and another with X chromosomes both are in equal numbers. Thus offspring's sex depends on whether it is the X bearing sperm or Ybearing sperm that fertilizes the egg. In humans Y-chromosomes has only a few of its genes active. They also have a few genes not found on the X chromosomes. Many of the genes on the X chromosomes behaves as if they are present in singles and not in pairs as stated in mendels law.
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
<h4>Sex Linkage characters:</h4> characters that are detemined by genes on only the X-chromosomes are observed to be sex-linked because they show a different pattern of inheritance in both males and females.
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
<h4>Multiple Alleles:</h4> There are genes that have more than two alleles. Such genes are called multiple alleles. Example is the gene that controls the ABO blood group in humans.
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
<h4>Polygenic inheritance:</h4>Polygenicinheritance is a pattern of inheritance that shown by a character that is controlled by many genes residing at different loci. Such characters show a more or less continuous variation in its expression. Examples of such is skin colour and height in humans.
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
<h4>Mutations:</h4> This is an error in the replication of a genetic material. It is a permanent change in DNA structure that can give rise to a new character. It can also destroy a given character.
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
<strong>Sickle cell anaemia</strong>and <strong>haemophilia</strong> are due to mutations. Mutation can also be advantageous. Such mutations provide needed raw materials for evolution
</div>

<h4 class="ce h_bio">
Non Disjunction
</h4>

<div class="pa paj">
This is a serious genetic disorder, which is due to the failure of chromosomes to separate properly during meiosis. When this occurs, the resulting egg or sperm will carry an unusual number of chromosomes. A study of human karyotype (A photograph of the arrangement of chromosomes of a cell, in order, from largest to smallest) shows that non disjunction may occur in any of the human chromosomes. Non disjunction of a given chromosomes causes a particular group of symptoms called <strong>syndrome.</strong>
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
This include 
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
<b>(i) Down's Syndrome</b> (caused by non disjunction of the 21<sup>st</sup> chromosome). stIndividuals with such syndrome have extra copy of 21<sup>st</sup> chromosomes. Such individuals are characterized by abnormal eyelids, large tongues short and broad hands, short stature, mental retardation. Many have deformed hearts.
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
<b>(ii) Klinefelter's Syndrome</b> (non disjunction of <b>X</b> chromosomes resulting to a male with extra Xchromosomes (ie <b>XXY</b> genetype instead of <b>XY</b>) such man will be sterile and have less than normal intelligence.
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
<b>(iii) Turner's Syndrome</b> (Also caused by non disjunction of <b>X</b> chromosomes). This result to female with missing <b>X</b> chromosomes (with genotype <b>XO</b> instead of <b>XX</b>). Such women will have large necks, their organs and breasts do not develop to adult stage as such they will be sterile.
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
<h4 class="h_bio">Applications of the principles of heredity</h4>
Genetic principles discovered in the transmission of traits from parents to offsprings can be applied in Agriculture, such as <b>controlled breeding</b> which is allowing only those plants or animals with particular traits to reproduce. This produce offspring with desirable genetics trait.
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
Controlled breeding includes: Inbreeding<strong></strong> and <strong>Hybridization.</strong>
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
<strong>Cloning and Recombination</strong> of DNA are other ares of application of genetics principles (<strong>the use of recombinant DNA and Cloning is commonly called genetic enginering</strong>).
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
Genetics can also be applied in medicine, in providing counseling for <strong>genetic disorder</strong>  among humans <strong>Rhesus factor, genetic therapy, Amniocentesis</strong> among married couples etc.
