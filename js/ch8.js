How do I make my product clean, using the blue ocean strategy. The blue strategy is a strategy, whereby you create your demand and debunk the old maxims of “slaughtered competitions”. Even when the ocean is red, you can clean it with your own philosophy. Have a unque product or service that speaks so much volume about you, let us say differentiation. Let the price be friendly. Sell value. The world is a big place, people have problems and they would be happy to pay for solutions to their problems. You have bought this piece and by the grace of God, you would be happy that certain information is supplied to our mind stock. </div> 	<div class="pa">You can create your market. The world is waiting for your product or service. It’s important we develop relationship with people. It would be a great service, as we try our best studying why people buy product or service. Relationship matters a lot. No woman would love to date a stranger. No sim card will ring, before its activation.</div> 	<div class="pa">God told Abraham, I will make thee of a great nation. When you look at the relationship that existed between Abraham and God, it was a deep and sound relationship. It was not as if Abraham, became friend of God because of what he wanted. He naturally obeyed and loved God. Statistics have shown that relationship is a major feat in selling in the business world. You need to develop close and sound relationship. Nigeria has a population of one hundred and eighty million people, you can start building good and great relationship. If you need to tell yourself, how much do I  want to make? You have to tell your mind, I am not going to put water in the pot and turn off the burner that is going to  be a wishful thinking. How much do I want to charge? Create awareness about your product/service to the minds of the people. Bring the product/service out, people will buy on the value you have to sell to them. Blue ocean strategy is about product differentiation, low cost and making competition irrelevant.  (Professors W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne).</div>';
