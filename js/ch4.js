Most old folks and some youths love his songs. He even said in one of his songs that, he cae into the world to sing. We can tell and say that is his passion. All gifts come from God that is the reason we must return all glory back to him. Bill Gates knew that he had passion in software and he sincerely went for it. If Michael Jordan had been a footballer, I am not sure, if he would have been acclaimed as one of the greatest in soccer. But, he is one of the greatest basket ballers, that earns him <i class="b">-“Air Jordan”</i></div> 	<div class="pa">Oh Lord, give me the ability that is equal to my opportunity.<br><i class="b">-Dr. D. K. Olukoya</i></div> 	<div class="pa">Joseph had always spoken about his dreams.His brothers felt threatened about his dream. Joseph knew that God had given a gift or a talent. He kept interpreting dreams for people, the butler and the baker. God had given Joseph the ability that is equal to this opportunity. He was able to tell Pharaoh the interpretation of his dream. God supplied all he need Joseph needed, even while he was in the prison. He was favored in the prison. What is your passion? I am about to tell one of the painful moment in my life as you relax to listen to this fact, pay close attention, very well.</div> 	<div class="pa">At that brightfullafternoon, I had no money with me. I have always loved to write, free for people. I was not too happy that I had no money with me, I told myself, “you need to think”. I remember that I have done my prayers for that day.</div> 	<div class="pa"> All manners o thought crept into my mind, James, what would you do, since, there is no money in the pocket. I took a pen and a paper, and came about on interview game. I went to a tutorial center, who I had developed great relationship with. Fortunately, for me they would be having celebration feast. They looked at the interview game and they had meeting about the game. At the end of the board meeting, the interview game was chosen as part of the celebration feast. I was invited by the owners of the tutorial center. The winner of the game was awarded N10,000 and I was credited with N5,000. I became very happy. I had to give thanks to God, because, I never knew that God had given me a skill. But, I was able to sell my gift but never presented it to them as sale, at initial stage. They tested and they loved it. They bought it. You have gift. Search for your passion, ask God and He will tell you.</div>';
