chx[chx.length] = '<div class="headaChap">GENIUS	</div> 	<div class="pa">GEN12:2, I have made thee a great nation</div> 	<div class="pa">Everyone is a genius, it all depends on what you believe in. I want you to know that God had created us in his own image and this have spelt the word, that we are god on this earth. What do I mean by this statement? I would want you to pay close attention to this passage and carefully observe I with a keen mind,so that you would understand very well what I mean that you are genius. Gen 7:1, and the Lord said unto Moses, see, I have made thee a god to pharaoh; and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet. </div> 	<div class="pa">At this juncture, I want you and I to look at the word “Prophet” your own “prophet” might be that you can sing a song. Your own “Prophet” might be that you can write. Your own “Prophet” might be that you can talk. What is your own “prophet”? Aaron was like an assistant to Moses. You have your own “prophet”. Go to God in prayer and He will tell you what your own “prophet” is. God told David that he is a man after His heart. David was a man of God. David goes to God in prayer, before any battle. You can call David a “prophet”, because he asks God, before he ventures into any war. Although, in real sense David was a prophet, because he spoke about the future. I would be happy that both the president, his Excellency Muhammadu Buhari and Vice-President, Pastor Yemi Osinbajo can read  this piece. There was a point in time China, population was a serious problem. It was a heavy complaint.</div> 	<div class="pa"> Where I am going in the journey of relevance, as far as this discussion is. China has turned this challenge into strength. As a result of this legendary position, China is the world heavy most populated nation in the world. The nation have seen opportunities in gray areas of human caused problem. The Chinese nation had to think inward. We can see that help does not come from East, West, North or South as the bible had rightly said, help comes from God, this is genius. Who is a genius?  Genius is a person who displays exceptional intellectual ability, creative productivity, and unisersality in originality.</div> 	<div class="pa">My understanding about this whole marathon of letters is that, Chinese nation were creative in productivity and their universality in originality they got solution to a great problem that had once wrecked their nation. How can we use our God given talent to creae a lasting solution to Nigeria situation? From the definition, we are told that anyone and everyone can be a genius. When we pray to God, we close our eyes to avoid distraction and focus our mind to God in prayer. Our Lord Jesus Christ haad to bless the Father and thanked Him, when be changed water into wine. We know that Thomas Edison invented the ligh bulb. Acording to his assistants, there were moments, he had to go into darkroom aand sit there for hours, until  solution to a problem is presented.</div> 	<div class="pa">History will be kind to me. I intend to write it – Winston Churchill</div>';
