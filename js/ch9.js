I also realize that most people would love to have a bite and patronize “this puff puff man”, puff seller. I had realized that, most people do not mind buying almost all the puffs from the seller because of the irresistible condition of the balls, “hot hot,” you can make your product irresistible to the taste of the people, you would sell your products or services.</div>';chx[chx.length] = '<div class="headaChap">PRODUCTIVITY </div> 	<div class="pa">1 Peter 2;9 <br ><i class="b">“But ye are a chosen generation a royal priest hard, a holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should show forth the praises of him who hath called  you out of darkness into his marvelous light”</i> </div> 	<div class="pa">The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands in times of challenge and controversy -  Martin Luther King, Jr. </div> 	<div class="pa">Who do you see yourself as?

It is time, Nigeria you have to move and hear what God had spoken to you, “I have made thee a great nation”, we all have to come out with those fertilized ideas, we are a peculiar people.

People are waiting for your story. It would sell, all you need is to do is look at the sky and embrace the challenges, that comes on the way. Moses was the only Prophet God spoke to in plain words. Moses was a meek man. He had what I call integrity that is part of character. He chose Israelite over the Egyptian.Moses was referred to as orator. Although, he had speech impediment, slow in speech.
