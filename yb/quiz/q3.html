<h4>Background Information</h4>
<h4 class="h_bio">DIGESTION OF FOOD</h4>
Heterotrophs are organisms that cannot make their food from simple inorganic substance, rather they feed on already available organic food substances. The complex nature of the organic materials most of these heterotrophs take requires that before the food  can be absorbed and assimilated into their bodies, they need not only be ingested but they must be digested (a catabolic process).
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
Digestion in an organism (Heterotrophs) depends on its complexity and size. The simple unicellular organisms for instance, carry out intracellular digestion within a food vacuole inside the cell while the multicellular organisms usually carry out extra cellular digestion with the gut.
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
<h4 class="h_bio">
FEEDING MECHANISMS
</h4>
Organisms have special structures with which they ingest food substances, digest them before they are absorbed into the organism’s body. These structures which are called feeding mechanisms also vary according to the organism’s size, complexity and type of food it takes in.
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
Feeding mechanisms, modification and adaptations for some organisms are discussed in the table that follows under: Feeding Adaptation and Modication in Amoeba, paramecium, Hydra, Filter feeders, Fluid feeders, Feeding adaptations and modications in insects, saprophyte and parasitic feeding modifications.</div>

<tr>
<td>1. <b>Amoeba proteus</b><br />
(intracellular digestion) feeds on diatoms</td><td>
Feeding is by phagocytosis. Itsurrounds its prey with pseudopods,then forms a food vacuole. Digestive enzymes which is released into this vacuoles breaks down the prey, the food is then absorbed by the cell.</td><td>

<tr>
<td>3. <b>Hydra </b><br />First Extra cellular digestion by digestive enzymes at the gut walls of the endoderm then later intra cellular digestion by amoboid cell in the endoderm.</td><td>
The cilia sweep food organisms down to the base of the gullet through the oral groove. A food vacuoles is formed at the base of the gullet. The vacuole later moves into the cytoplasm where the food is digested by enzyme and absor-bed into the cytoplasm. Indigested wastes are posed out through the anal pore</td><td>
Stinging cells, tentacles mouth and gut cavity.</td>

<tr>
<td>4. <b>Filter feeders</b> among which include: sponge; Bivalves (eg molluscs or oysters) water eas, smaller shes and mos-quito larvae, whales etc.They can feed on plankton <strong>digestion is extracelluar</strong></td><td>The stinging cells (nematocysts) paralyses a prey then pushes its tentacle. The tentaclecoils round the pray and pushes it through the mouth into the gut cavity. Here it is partially digested by enzymes from digestive juice of the gut wall. Amoboid cell in the endoderm later completes the digestion. Egestion takes place throughthe mouth.</td><td>
Cilia or appendages, sieves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5. <b>Fluid feeder</b> eg Humming birds,buttery, moths, ephids, tape-worm mosquitoes.</td><td>
They usually trap thefood in most cases by means of cilia or other structures like movement of its appendages, the animal draws water which contains the food. The water passes through a sieve in front of the gut, the food is ltered off for digestion while the water passes out of the body.</td><td>Long pointed beaksin humming bird, long coiled feeding tubes (proboscis) in butterfly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7. <b>Saprophytic feeding</b><br />Examples: Rhizopus andmucor. They carry out  extracellular digestion</td><td>The rhizoids penetrate into the substrate with their tips secreting enzymes like amylases and proteases out of the hyphal wall into the substrate. Digestion takes place and the soluble products of glucose and amino acid diffuse through the hyphal wall into the cytoplasm.</td><td>Rhizoids and its thin walls and branches.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>8. <b>Parasitic organisms</b><br /> Eg. Liver uke tape worm, hookworm, lice etc.</td><td>Tapeworm have no alimentary canal, round worms have simple alimentary canal. They use their well adapted mouth parts to feed on food from their hosts.</td><td>
Like the case of tapeworm there are hooks and suckers.</td>

Feeding in insect
</h4>
nsects carry out extra cellular digestion e.g. Buttery, Mosquito Cockroach Grasshopper etc.
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
Different insects have different mechanisms of feeding process and their various mouth parts are adapted for their kinds of foods eg. Piercing and sucking for mosquito, cutting, crushing and grinding in Cockroaches and grasshoppers, sucking for buttery and housey etc.

<div class="pa paj">
<strong>
Digestion, which is the breaking down of complex and large molecule food substances into simpler and smaller ones</strong> takes place in mammals in a long tube like structure called <b>Alimentary canal</b> or <b>Gut.</b> Alimentary canal begins at the mouth and ends at the anus. It also consists of the Gullet or oesophagus, stomach, small and large intestines. Different parts of the alimentary canal are modied into specialized organs and structures, which perform specic functions.
</div>
<div class="pa paj">

<b>Digestion</b> is of two types:<b> Mechanical digestion</b> and <b>Chemical digestion.</b>
</div>
<div class="pa paj">In mechanical digestion, food is physically broken down into smaller particles by chewing in the mouth by the teeth and muscular churning by the muscular walls of the alimentary canal. This helps to prepare the food for quick chemical digestion by exposing large amount of food to action of enzymes through increase in surface area of the food particles.
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
Under chemical digestion, there is a chemical breakdown of complex molecules of food into simpler ones by the action of enzymes.
</div>
<div class="pa paj"><strong>
Various parts of the alimentary canal and their roles in food digestion</strong>
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
<b>The mouth:</b> Mechanical digestion starts at the mouth by the action of the teeth on the food. Several secretions are added to the food.
<ol type="i">
<li>Mucus secretion from the cells lining the mouth moistens the food </li><li>Salivary secretions from the salivary gland, which not only moistens the food but starts off chemical digestion by converting starch to maltose. The tongue also helps to put the food in proper position
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
The Oesophagus: This carries food from the mouth to the stomach by a process which involves rhythmic muscular action called peristalsis and the lubricated oesophagus lining with mucous which eases food passage.
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
The Stomach: Food is received into the stomach from the esophagus by the relaxation of the rst sphincter muscle. Three kinds of cells make secretions at the stomach, one secretes mucous, the other enzymes while the third one secretes waterand hydrochloric acid. These three secretions together form gastric juice. The Hcl (hydrochloric acid) helps to break up connection tissue and cell membrane in food, it also kills many harmful bacteria. Pepsin breaks down protein into polypeptide. There is also rennin which cuddles the milk. The chemical digestion in the stomach is aided by the churning action of the second sphincter which moves food out of the stomach.The small intestine: The small intestine is of three parts: The duodenum which is the rst part, the Jejunum which is the second part and the third part called the ileum.
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
Secretions from the pancreas and gallbladder enter the small intestine at the duodenum. These secretions are pancreatic juice and bile (bile is produced by the liver but stored at the gall bladder) pancreatic juice contains digestive enzymes. Amylopsin which breaks down starch to maltose, lipase which breaks down fats and oil to fatty acids and glyceroland trypsin which breaks down proteins to polypeptides.Bile provides an alkaline medium for enzymes of the pancreatic juice to act; it adds water to the chyme (a thick creamy uid the food forms into in the stomach). It also breaks down fats into tiny droplets (emulsication).
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
At the illium digestion of carbohydrate, protein fats and oil is completed. Food here is more watery and it is called chyle
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
Digestion here is by the action of enzymes from the intestinal juice maltose is broken down to glucose by maltase. Erepsinbreaks down polypeptides to amino acids while lipase changes fats and oil to fatty acids and glycerol.
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
<h4 class="h_bio">Absorption of digested food</h4>
Absorption of glucose, fatty acids and glycerol, amino acids, vitamins and mineral salts take place in the small intestine.The small intestine is well adapted to carry out the function by the presence of the following features
</div>
<div class="pa paj"><strong>
<ul type="square">
<li>
Folds and furrows in the walls of the small intestine which serves to increase its surface area
</li><li>The presence of small ngerlike projections called villi which further gives it increased surface area.
</li><li>A rich supply of blood vessels and lymphatic vessels containing blood and lymph
</li>
</ul></strong>
</div>
<div class="pa paj">
All absorbed food are brought to the liver via the lymphatic portal vein before they are assimilated into the body. the liver can convert, break down, store or leave unchanged the egested through the anus after more water absorption has taken place through the anus after more water absorption has taken place through the anus.
