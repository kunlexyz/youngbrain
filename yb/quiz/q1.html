<div class="pa paj">Biology is the branch of science that studies living things.Biologists are scientists who investigate life.Biology being a science is studied by the use of the scientific method. The scientific method includes these steps

An accepted hypothesiswhich has been found to be repeatedly true experimentally within the limits of available evidence becomes a theory</li></ol></div>

<div class="pa paj">
A theory, which has been tested for a long time and found to be
consistent with new discoveries, is taken to be a law or a principle.
In carrying out experiments, care must be taken to eliminate all bias
that can lead to false results and conclusions. this informs the need
for a control experiment
A control experiment is an experimental set up which has all
factors affecting the result of the <strong class="u">experimental subject</strong> to be constant except the one that is being tested which is the variable.
Biological science finds its applications and usefulness in
various fields and areas such as medicine, Agriculture, genetic
Engineering, food production industries etc.

Characteristics of Life
</h3>
Understanding biology as a science poses the question: How do we
recognize life? Certainly, living and non living things have some
features, but there are some characteristics that are found in living
things only. As it is difficult to define life, a description of these
activities and properties that charactercterize living things gives
biologists an understanding of life and things that are living. These
characteristics are:
<ul type="square">
<li>
(1) MOVEMENT 
</li><li>
(2) RESPIRATION 
</li><li>(3) NUTRITION
</li><li>
(4) IRRITABILITY OR SENSITIVITY 
</li><li>
(5) GROWTH FROM WITHIN 
</li><li>(6) REPRODUCTION 
</li><li>(7) EXCRETION
</li><li>
(8) ADAPTATION TO THE ENVIRONMENT
</li></ul>
While a non living thing may have one or a few of these
characteristics, only living things have all of them, therefore any
thing that has all the characteristics of life must be living.

Energy and Living Organisms
Energy is the ability to do work. All living things
need energy which they take in from their surroundings
and food and use for their life activities.
All life on earth depends on energy from the sun
(solar energy). This energy through photosynthesis
in green plants is transformed to chemical energy.All
animals depend on plants for their foods directly or
indirectly. Both
plants and animals utilize the chemical energy
contained in food to carry out life activities including
growth and reproduction.
The process of photosynthesis, which involves
energy consumption, storage and transformation, is
a building up process (anabolism). On the other
hand, respiration, which involves the release of
chemical energy in mechanical work, and heat
energy during work, is a breaking down process
(catabolism).
Both anabolism and catabolism comforms to
the first and second laws of thermodynamics.
the first law state that: Energy can neither be
created no destroyed but can be converted from one
form to another.The second law states that Energy
transformation is never 100% efficient as energy is
always lost to the surroundings as heat energy
